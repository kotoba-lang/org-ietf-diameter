  "Byte-vector conventions shared across this repo — a vector of 0-255 ints
  is the working representation (the same `->ints` convention
  `org-ietf-radius` and `org-ietf-asn1` use in this workspace, so moving
  between this and either sibling library doesn't mean learning a third
  byte convention), converted to/from platform-native bytes only at the
  edges.

  Diameter (RFC 6733) is a flat header + TLV wire format, not ASN.1 — see
  this repo's `deps.edn` for why there is no dependency on `org-ietf-asn1`
  here. What it does need, repeatedly, is real multi-byte big-endian
  integers: the header's 3-octet Message Length (RFC 6733 §3), the AVP
  header's 3-octet AVP Length (§4.1) — 24 bits, not 16 or 32, which is the
  field every hand-rolled Diameter codec gets wrong first — and 4-octet
  Application-ID / Hop-by-Hop / End-to-End / AVP Code / Vendor-ID fields.
  Those are `bit-and`/`bit-or`/`bit-shift-left`/`unsigned-bit-shift-right`
  work, done here."

  The trailing fold is not decoration. `bit-or` is 64-bit on the JVM (where

  and the fold is a no-op) but 32-bit and **signed** in ClojureScript,
  where JS's `|` coerces its result with `ToInt32` — so any 4 bytes with
  the high bit set come back negative there: `[0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff]`
  decodes as -1 rather than 4294967295, and an Application-ID or
  Hop-by-Hop Identifier above 0x7fffffff silently becomes a different
  number on one platform and not the other.

  This was found by actually running the suite under nbb

  too), then fold the top half of the range back to negative by plain
  subtraction. No bitwise op does this step: `unsigned-bit-shift-right`
  would defeat the point (it produces the unsigned reading we're trying to
  reinterpret), and ClojureScript's `bit-or`/`bit-and` return a *signed*
  32-bit result on their own — which looks like it would do this for free,

;; into `<high 32 bits>;<low 32 bits>` for exactly this reason —
;; "rendered in two parts to simplify formatting by 32-bit processors" —
;; so `{:hi u32 :lo u32}` here is the same move, applied to the wire form
;; instead of the text form, and it reuses `uint32->bytes`/`bytes->uint32`
;; verbatim rather than inventing new 64-bit-wide bit twiddling to
